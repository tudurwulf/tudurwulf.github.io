      <h1 id="breathtuner">BreathTuner</h1>
      
      <p>The brain is like a musical instrument – it needs a good tuning once in a while.</p>
      
      <p>BreathTuner is a biofeedback app which helps the user get centered through conscious breathing. It is especially useful for those with cognitive-intense desk jobs, who frequently experience a loss of <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/poise">poise</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness">situation awareness</a>.</p>
      
      <h2 id="how-to-use">How to use</h2>
      
      <p>First adopt an uncompressed posture so lungs and heart can function unhindered. Don't pull back the shoulders, as that would only create unnecessary tension. Simply expand the torso until the spine feels <em>gently stretched</em>.</p>
      
      <p>Next, immerse yourself in the present moment and become mindful of your surroundings. This is a mental state we frequently found ourselves in during the course of evolution while venturing through the Serengeti. The following meditation technique only serves to deepen this state of mind.</p>
      
      <p>Take a breath in; then:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Let exhalation slowly <strong>fade in</strong>. When you can feel the air flowing, press [Space].</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Keep the air flow <strong>slow and uninterrupted</strong>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When starting to run out of air, let the breath slowly <strong>fade out</strong>. Do not hold it by closing the glottis, but imagine the air flow continuing to fade out infinitely.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Rest</strong> in this quiet space for about 5 seconds.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Repeat from step 1 for inhalation, trying to balance the times.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Notes:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The most important part is the transition between two half-breaths. Allow each exhalation/inhalation to vanish and emerge by itself, without forcing it. When vanishing, it's similar to the dying sound of a <a href="http://www.freesound.org/people/suburban%20grilla/sounds/2166/">singing bowl</a>. When emerging, it's the reverse.</p>
      
          <p>If done correctly, it should not be possible to consciously pinpoint the exact moment when one half-breath stopped and the next began. It ought to feel as if the breath is continuous, only occasionally slowing down bellow the perceptual threshold, but never really pausing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Exhale and inhale only through the nose, so you can remain entirely focused on the points of transition rather than getting distracted by opening and closing the mouth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Aim to expose yourself to mild air hunger at the end of each half-breath.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Breathe this way for at least 5 full breaths, preferably until your mind becomes <em>calm and alert</em>.</p>
      
      <p>For the best results, follow each breath tuning session with 2 minutes of <a href="http://youtu.be/Ks-_Mh1QhMc">power posing</a> to decrease cortisol and increase testosterone levels, then 3 minutes of cardio to increase <a href="http://youtu.be/IK1nMQq67VI?t=13m00s">brain blood flow</a>. It all takes a mere 10 minutes.</p>
      
      <p>Repeat every 90 minutes by timer. Even 3 full tuning breaks per day will produce noticeable results in only 1 week.</p>
